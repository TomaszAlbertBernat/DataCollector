const fileProcessor = new FileProcessor();
await fileProcessor.processDirectory('Transcriptions_All/');

// Search indexing
const searchEngine = new HybridSearchEngine();
await searchEngine.indexContent(processedFiles);

// AI analysis
const aiService = new LangChainService();
await aiService.analyzeContent(mentalHealthContent);
```

### Frontend Integration
```typescript
// Search interface
const searchResults = await api.search({
  query: "meditation anxiety",
  filters: { category: "meditation" }
});

// Content display
const documentViewer = new DocumentViewer();
documentViewer.displayContent(mentalHealthFile);
```

## 📋 Test Scenarios
